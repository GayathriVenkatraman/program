# Advanced JavaScript

This module is about the JavaScript patterns that power backend systems: transforming data with array methods, handling asynchronous operations with callbacks and Promises, consuming APIs, and modeling domains with classes.

## Module Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- [ ] Use array methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) to transform, query, and aggregate data
- [ ] Chain array methods into data transformation pipelines
- [ ] Write concise arrow functions with implicit and explicit returns
- [ ] Pass functions as arguments and return functions from functions (higher-order functions)
- [ ] Use callbacks for synchronous and asynchronous operations, including error-first callbacks
- [ ] Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution in JavaScript
- [ ] Consume and create Promises using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `new Promise()`
- [ ] Use `async`/`await` with `try`/`catch` for clean asynchronous code
- [ ] Fetch data from APIs and run parallel requests with `Promise.all()`
- [ ] Declare classes with constructors, methods, and static methods
- [ ] Use inheritance with `extends` and `super()`
