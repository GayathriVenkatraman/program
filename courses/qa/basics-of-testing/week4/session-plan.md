## Session Materials

In this session, we will learn the fundamentals of test design and structured test case writing. We will explore the difference between heuristics and oracles, understand the key components of a test case, and compare good versus bad examples. The session also introduces test data management and two essential black-box test design techniques: Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis. Trainees will apply these techniques in practical exercises to strengthen their analytical thinking and test design skills.
