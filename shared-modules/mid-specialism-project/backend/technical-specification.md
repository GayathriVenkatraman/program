# Technical Specification (Spec) Backend

## Implementation Requirements

You should use the technologies, skills, tools, and stack you've learned throughout the course. Here are some specific requirements that you must meet in your implementation:

<!-- TODO: These requirements are by no means complete, just a couple of examples from each course curriculum to give a good example of how it should map to what we teach in the course -->

- [ ] Database schema must be documented with an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- [ ] Database must use PostgreSQL
- [ ] All database queries must use parameterized queries (no SQL injection vulnerabilities)

## API

We already have a fully functional API that you should use during your frontend development. You are welcome to make changes to it to change the data or add additional data. You can also add additional endpoints, if it is required for a new feature idea you have. However, the existing API functionality should remain in place and not break.

We already have an API in place, but it is missing many features that you will be required to implement. You can find the API specification below, which describes what you will need to implement to complete the project.

<!-- Part of the project is to design APIs, not only implement planned interfaces, so this will be a mix of documented and working enpoints, fully specced endpoints, as well as placeholders for endpoints that the trainee must design themselves e.g. in line with their data model -->

<!-- TODO: Add or link to API contract specification - ultimately, this documentation should probably live inside the project skeletons, since the trainees will also own making changes to it as needed. -->
