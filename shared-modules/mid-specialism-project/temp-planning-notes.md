## Temp Planning Notes

<!-- TODO: These are planning notes to be removed or moved before going live -->

We will create two apps, frontend and backend, from [hyf-project-template](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-project-template). Both courses should start with some state of runnable, working app. The starting point is up to us. They should have some code they have to "work out" at the start, just like when you start in a new job.

**Backend:**

- Basic API, runnable
- Initial API docs in place
- Initial database

**Frontend:**

- Basic frontend app, runnable
- Fully working, documented API via json-server, easily editable
