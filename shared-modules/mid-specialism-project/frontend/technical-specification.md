# Technical Specification (Spec) Frontend

## Implementation Requirements

You should use the technologies, skills, tools, and stack you've learned throughout the course. Here are some specific requirements that you must meet in your implementation:

<!-- TODO: These requirements are by no means complete, just a couple of examples from each course curriculum to give a good example of how it should map to what we teach in the course -->

- [ ] App must use React Router with distinct routes (e.g. event list, event detail, cart, orders)
- [ ] Shared state (e.g. cart, user session) must use React Context

## API

We already have a fully functional API that you should use during your frontend development. You are welcome to make changes to it to change the data or add additional data. You can also add additional endpoints, if it is required for a new feature idea you have. However, the existing API functionality should remain in place and not break.

<!-- For frontenders, the API will already be working and complete. For backenders, the API will also have some placeholders - part of the project is to design APIs, not only implement planned interfaces. -->

<!-- TODO: Add or link to API contract specification - ultimately, this documentation should probably live inside the project skeletons, since the trainees will also own making changes to it as needed. -->
