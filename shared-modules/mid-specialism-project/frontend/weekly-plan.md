# Weekly plan

Here is a guideilne of the outcomes you should reach each week to stay on track.

<!-- Guide for writing these:
These weekly goals need to ensure two things:
1. What trainees learn from the corresponding week in [React](/courses/frontend/react/README.md) module are practiced here in the right place
2. Requirements from the [PRD](../product-requirements-document.md) and [frontend spec](../frontend/technical-specification.md) are well structured and ordered to ensure trainees can reach the end goal by week 5.

For some context on how we ordered the milestones in the old meal sharing project, check [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/program/blob/main/contributing/proposals/mid-specialism-course-project.md#old-meal-sharing-content). Note that we have changed the structure of the corresponding modules too, but there is a big overlap in learning goals.
