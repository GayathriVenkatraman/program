# Session Plan

## AI in the development workflow

### Workflow overview
0. Personal development - Reading, learning, practicing new software development skills
1. Problem definition - Understanding what we're trying to solve
2. Planning - Deciding what to build
3. Design - Deciding how it should work and look
4. Implementation - Building the software
5. Testing - Ensuring it all works correctly
6. Code review - Getting feedback and finalising the code
7. Deployment - Shipping it to users
8. Monitoring - Making sure things keep working as intended

After the overview, go through some specific phases to highlight key ways AI can support them. Of course there are many possiblilities in every phase (and we should encourage trainees to explore them themselves!), but the below are mostly aimed to inspire and give some concrete examples that trainees can start using today.

### 0. Personal development
#### Learning
Outside of HYF or work, spending time learning and practicing new development skills is important. This could be learning new programming languages, frameworks, tools or concepts.

Here's some examples:

1. "Explaining by comparison" prompt

Learn quickly by mapping new knowledge to things you already understand.

```
I know how to do X in <this language I already know>:

<paste code snippet here>

Show me how to write the same functionality in <new language> and explain:
1. What concepts are the same
2. What's different and why
3. What would surprise a developer coming from <language I already know>
```

2. The "Code Tutor" prompt

Learn a new language/framework/tool through practice, and getting feedback to improve.

```
I'm learning how to do X in <language/framework/tool>. Here is my current solution:

<paste code snippet here>

Review this as if I were a junior developer:
1. Point out any issues, bugs or bad practices
2. Suggest better practices or patterns
3. Explain what each change means and why it matters
4. Create a mini summary of why I should study next, based on my weaknesses and mistakes
```

3. The "Learning plan" prompt

If you have a big topic ahead of you, get help to create a learning path to help you stay on track and avoid becoming overwhelemed.

```
I want to learn X as a developer who already knows Y and Z. Create a 4 week self-study plan focussed on hands-on coding practice.

For each week, include:
1. Key concepts to learn
2. One small practical project
3. Common mistakes and misunderstandings beginners make
4. How this new thing differs from what I already know
```

##### Exericse 1

Use each of the three prompts above using your own personal learning goals, and evaluate what you like and don't like about the output of the AI. Bonus: Try tweaking a prompt template to shape the output more to your own personal needs.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Top tip**
If AI writes code you can’t explain:

* Slow down
* Ask why
* Rewrite it yourself until you understand

That is the moment where learning happens, so don't miss out by skipping ahead!
{% endhint %}

### 3. Design
#### Code explanation
While preparing the ideas for a solution, you likely need to understand existing code.

TODO add some prompting examples here, as well as good follow up prompts

##### Exercise 2

Get AI to help explain the code in Exercise 2. Ask follow up questions until you have a good grasp of what every function and line of code is achieving.

### 4. Implementation
#### Learning new approaches
##### Exercise 3

#### Code refactoring
##### Exercise 4

#### Bug fixing
##### Exercise 5

#### Documentation generation
##### Exercise 6
Exercise 3: Learning new approaches
Exercise 4: Code refactoring
Exercise 5: Bug fixing
Exercise 6: Documentation generation

### 6. Code review
Exercise 7: Code review assistance


## AI in the workplace

### Ethics, legal and risk considerations

TODO these follow on from the foundation content, but should be give more software dev specific examples, like the risk of pasting protected IP code or customer data into third party AI tools.

### The future of AI in development

We don't know the future for sure, that's what makes it exciting. There are some trends that we are seeing:

#### Trends

1. Less time typing code
2. The gap between junior and mid-level narrows
3. More cross-functional roles
4. Understanding the "why"
5. Super fast industry shifts

#### Tips

1. Stay in the loop of AI developments
- Follow key organisations in the space (OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft/Github, Google/Gemini)
- Join in conversations with other developers online and offline to see what they're experiencing
- Follow AI related news

2. Learn and practice with new tools/features
- Try out new AI features and capabilities as they are released
- Use AI tools in your real projects to practice

3. Integrate useful parts into your own workflow
- Whatever you find works well, integrate it into your own daily working practices
