# Assignment

## Part A: Review and Improve Portfolio

In the previous AI module, you created an initial version of your portfolio. In this assignment, you'll use AI to review, improve, and document your work.

1. **Get a code review** - Use AI to review your portfolio code. Ask for feedback on readability, best practices, potential bugs, and security.

2. **Note improvements** - From the feedback, identify at least 3 improvements or changes you want to make. Write these down.

3. **Implement the changes** - Make the improvements to your code. Use AI to help if needed, but make sure you understand each change.

4. **Generate a diagram** - Use AI to generate an ASCII diagram that describes the structure of your portfolio project.

5. **Reflect on learnings** - Write down 3 new things you learned from the review and implementation process.

## Part B: Ethics and Risks

Choose 3 ethical issues or risks associated with the use of AI in development (refer to the session material if you need a reminder).

For each one, describe:
- What the issue/risk is, in your own words
- How you will personally mitigate it in your own use of AI

## Submission

Submit your updated portfolio code, along with a `reflection.md` file containing:
- Your list of improvements from Part A
- Your diagram from Part A
- Your 3 learnings from Part A
- Your 3 ethical issues and mitigations from Part B
